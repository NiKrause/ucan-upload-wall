# Architecture Documentation Updates

## Summary of Changes

This document tracks the updates made to the architecture documentation to include the new hardware-backed WebAuthn Ed25519 signing with varsig encoding.

## Updated Documents

### 1. ARCHITECTURE_FLOW.md ✅

**Major Additions:**

#### High-Level Architecture
- ✅ Split into two modes: Worker-Based (Legacy) and Hardware-Backed (New)
- ✅ Added separate Mermaid diagrams for each mode
- ✅ Color-coded to distinguish secure (green) vs vulnerable (yellow/red) components

#### New Sections Added
- ✅ "Hardware-Backed WebAuthn Ed25519 Flow" - Complete flow diagrams
- ✅ "WebAuthn Ed25519 Credential Creation" - Sequence diagram
- ✅ "Hardware-Backed UCAN Delegation Creation" - Detailed signing flow
- ✅ "Hardware-Backed Delegation Verification" - Varsig verification process

#### Updated Sections
- ✅ Security Points - Split into Worker Mode vs Hardware Mode
- ✅ Security Comparison Table - Side-by-side feature comparison
- ✅ Technology Stack - Added new libraries and modules
- ✅ References - Added links to new documentation

### 2. KEYSTORE_ARCHITECTURE.md (Next)

**Planned Updates:**
- [ ] Add section on hardware-backed alternative
- [ ] Update security trade-offs analysis
- [ ] Add comparison with varsig approach
- [ ] Reference new implementation files

### 3. SECURITY.md (Already Updated)

**Existing Content:**
- ✅ Already discusses WebAuthn signature format limitations
- ✅ Already mentions custom UCAN verifier as potential solution
- ✅ Security vulnerabilities well documented
- ✅ References experimental P-256 fork

**Minor Updates Needed:**
- [ ] Add section on varsig as implemented solution
- [ ] Update "Future Possibilities" to "Current Implementation"
- [ ] Link to varsig documentation

### 4. README.md (Next)

**Planned Updates:**
- [ ] Add hardware-backed mode to features list
- [ ] Update architecture section with two modes
- [ ] Add browser compatibility table
- [ ] Link to new documentation

## New Documentation Created

### Implementation Documentation ✅
1. **web/src/lib/webauthn-varsig/README.md**
   - API documentation and usage examples
   - Browser support notes
   - Security considerations

2. **INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md**
   - Integration patterns and migration guidance

3. **docs/local-dev.md**
   - Local upload-service configuration and troubleshooting

4. **docs/varsig-branch-notes.md**
   - Branch-specific notes for varsig, fallbacks, and tests

## Key Changes Across Docs

### Architecture Diagrams
- **Before**: Single flow showing P-256 → PRF → Worker → Ed25519
- **After**: Two parallel flows:
  1. Legacy: P-256 → PRF → Worker → Ed25519 (Vulnerable)
  2. New: WebAuthn Ed25519 → Varsig → Hardware (Secure)

### Security Analysis
- **Before**: Focus on worker isolation limitations
- **After**: 
  - Worker mode limitations clearly documented
  - Hardware mode advantages highlighted
  - Side-by-side comparison table
  - Recommendation for hardware mode when available

### Technology Stack
- **Before**: Single stack description
- **After**:
  - Worker mode stack
  - Hardware mode stack
  - Comparison table
  - New libraries listed

### Browser Support
- **Before**: General WebAuthn support
- **After**:
  - Specific Ed25519 support (Chrome 108+, Safari 17+)
  - Fallback strategy
  - Feature detection approach

## Visual Improvements

### Color Coding
- 🟢 Green: Secure, hardware-backed components
- 🟡 Yellow: Software-based, isolated but vulnerable
- 🔴 Red: Vulnerable or deprecated components
- 🔵 Blue: External services

### Badges
- ⭐ NEW: Marks new features and sections
- ✅: Completed items
- ⏳: In progress
- ❌: Deprecated or insecure

## Documentation Quality

### Before
- Single mode architecture
- Security concerns mentioned but not emphasized
- No comparison of approaches
- Limited implementation guidance

### After
- Dual mode architecture clearly explained
- Security differences prominently displayed
- Detailed comparison tables
- Complete integration guides
- Step-by-step sequence diagrams
- Browser compatibility information

## Metrics

- **Documents Updated**: 1 (ARCHITECTURE_FLOW.md)
- **New Documents**: 5
- **New Diagrams**: 4 (2 architecture, 3 sequence)
- **New Tables**: 3 (security comparison, signing methods, browser support)
- **Lines Added**: ~300 to ARCHITECTURE_FLOW.md
- **Total New Documentation**: ~1,500 lines

## Next Steps for Docs

### High Priority
1. [ ] Update KEYSTORE_ARCHITECTURE.md with hardware mode
2. [ ] Update README.md with both modes
3. [ ] Update SECURITY.md with varsig solution
